    <header>Problem Statement</header>
    <p>College is a popular route for students to further their education and build skills for a successful life. However, when it comes to choosing their major, students often struggle with discovering their career interests, and thus have a hard time finding the right major to pursue.</p>
    <h2>What's Wrong with Existing Tools?</h2>
    <p>The main problem is the use of stereotypical personality traits to categorize careers. They assume student will be interested in and good at a career that aligns with their hobbies.</p>
    <p>In addition, existing career tests often use questions with black-white answers, as well as, random questions that students don’t know the answers to, skewing results. Moreoever, the end results of these tests often include very technical terms as careers, which students sometimes do not understand.</p>

    <h2>Personas</h2>
    <p>Marilyn Reid is a 17yr old living in San Francisco, California. She currently attends Oak High School, while working part-time at Pokenomics. Between school and work, she also juggles field hockey practice and college applications. Marilyn finds herself stil unsure of what major to apply for each college. She's gone through countless career tests from google and her school but none are imaginable careers for her. She really wants to find a profession that is not only interesting to her but also allows her to be financially stable.</p>

He is an avid video gamer and often spends hours immersed in virtual worlds. In between gaming and watching Youtube Videos, Kade also practices baseball every day and workouts at the gym. Kade really just has no idea what he's interested in (besides baseball and video games). His parents keep pressuring him to do career research but reading through all the careers just overwhelms him.</p>

    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <p>On the landing page, students could first start exploring based on their favorite subject (humanities, STEM, business, or sports). Let's say they choose STEM. Within STEM, there are many real life industries they can explore, such as pharmaceutical or tech. Let’s say the choose the cell phone factory. There are many roles in addition to tech aspects, such as running the business or selling cell phones, or taking care of the legal side. And Intrigz shows the diversity of roles with easy to understand descriptions. Once they choose a role, they’ll be presented with more specific professions, such as industrial engineer or logistics manager. From here, Intrigz will show the majors they can pursue based on their interested profession. 
    <h2>Competitive Advantage</h2>
    <p>Why specifically is Intrigz better than others?</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Interactive - it's fun and engaging for students</li>

    <h2>Target Customer</h2>
    <p>The intended customer of Intrigz are schools. Specifically, guidance counselors and college career advisors in both public and private high schools in the US.</p>
    <h2>Business Plan</h2>
    <p>We will be using a B2B business model, where we'll charge schools $3 per student per year. We'll first start marketing to schools in California. And then following California, I plan on reaching out to high schools in other states with high enrollment, such as Texas and New York. </p>
    <h2>Marketing Plan</h2>
    <p>We'll first start by compiling a list of high schools, including total enrollment, counselor names, and counselor emails. We'll then use the google sheets automation function to mass send emails (max 50 per day) to high school counselors, introducing Intrigz to them. Below is the message template:</p>
